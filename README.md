# My smart home and home assistant scripts
Hi, my name is Itai, and as many people I got addicted to build a DIY smart home.

I've decided to share some of my scripts and automations so everyone can enjoy them.

If you like this repo, please star it, so I will know to invest more.

Please feel free to ask question or add suggestions in Issues section, or even send PRs.
